Beneath the quiet moon I lie,  
Where silver clouds drift soft and high,   
The world is hushed, the stars aglow,  
And time forgets which way to go.  

The trees like shadows gently sway,  
In rhythm with the end of day,   
A breeze that knows no name or face  
Whispers secrets through empty space.  

The grass is cool beneath my hand,   
Like threads of night across the land,   
Crickets sing their twilighttune—  
A lullaby beneath the moon.  

The worries of the waking light  
Dissolve into the arms of night,   
And all that once was sharp and loud   
Is softened by a passing cloud.  

The stars do not demand to shine,  
They simply do—no grand design—  
A lesson in their quiet grace  
For hearts that rush through every place.  

So let me rest beneath the sky,  
And watch the constellations sigh,   
For in this hush, I’ve come to see:  
The night is where I learn to be.
